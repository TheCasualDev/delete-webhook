# Delete Webhook
Simple python script that deletes webhooks 

# How to set-up
You can either download the built exe version found in the releases tab: [delete-webhook/releases](https://github.com/TheCasualDev/delete-webhook/releases)

Or if you wish you can simply download the main.py file found in the [delete-webhook/src](https://github.com/TheCasualDev/delete-webhook/blob/main/src) folder.

## Requirements for running the main.py
In order to run the raw python file please read the following
- Make sure you are using Python 3.11.4 or newer (you can check with the python -V command)
- Make sure you have [Colorama](https://github.com/tartley/colorama) installed.
- And if you are using Linux or Mac edit line 7 & 38 from ``os.system("cls")`` to ``os.system("clear")``

## How to use
Simply run the exe or if using the raw file simply CD into the directory and do ``python main.py`` then in the prompt that comes up simply put the link to the webhook you wish to delete.
